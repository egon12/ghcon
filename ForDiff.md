# File with git history 1


Ok, we need to do some examples with git change in this repository. So I will 
try to create some random sentences, and will delete and add some line in the 
latter. The first commit will be base for the PR number 2. So This text should
be a little bit long. Although I don't know what else that I need to write for
now.

But maybe this is good enough. Is this sentences is long enough for you to read
and to simulate deletion and addition of line? Well I don't know for sure. But
let's try it.

Just commit this file and try to create new branch from this commit. And then
try to add some comment, and delete this line below

"Hello this is supposed to be different than below"

"And yes, it is different than above, But don't know what happened."

Ok, I think that's enough, to play around with github commit, trial and error
